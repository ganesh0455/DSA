    Collections
-----------------------

Prerequisites for learning Collections 

1. What are classes
2. What are interfaces
3. How we are implementing (ikmplements key word) the interface
4. Arrays


Collections is a framework provided by java.
This framework provides many interfaces and their implemented classes in order to store group of objects (elements) in single objects.


Why collections..?

Disadvantages of arrays

1.We have to provide the size of array when it has been declared but we can't increase and decrease.
2.It is fixed size, it can't change it's size dinamically.
3.In arrays we can store only values but we can't store a key,values


For overcomming the disadvantages of array we use collections

Collection framework provides two interfaces

Collections (framework)
Collection (interface)

1.Collection <interface>
    i)  List
    ii) Set
    iii)Queue
2.Map <interface>

Classes provided by collections framework to implement abouve interfaces

here the 5 catogorizations for classes which are implement one particular interface

-------------------
1.List <interface>
-------------------
ArrayList
LinkedList
Vector
Stack

-------------------
2.Queue <interface>
-------------------
ArrayQueue
PriorityQueue

-------------------
3.Set <interface>
-------------------
HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet

-------------------
4.Map <interface>
-------------------
HashTable
HashMap
LinkedHashMap
TreeMap

5.Collections - Collections is also one of the class in collections framework, which is used to perform the common operations like sorting,filtering on any above specified classes.
